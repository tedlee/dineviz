###How the Extension Works
After installing the extension, when a user hits a FourSquare venue **[foursquare.com/v/VENUE_NAME/*]** the extension extracts the venueID and makes an JavaScript JSON call to FourSquare to get the latitude and longitude of the venue. Once we get the geographical data back we send a request to a server that houses a DineSafe API we built along with the name of the venue (from FourSquare).   

Server side we then narrow down potential matches based on lat/long and a venue name fuzzy search in an attempt to match up the FourSquare and DineSafe data. The server also stores a precalculated score for how "DineSafe" a place is based on the accumulation of previous inspections. This score along with all inspections are returned to the client and injected into the DOM.
